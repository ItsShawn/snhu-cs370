# Pirate Intelligent Agent – Portfolio Reflection (CS-370)
## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:

In this project, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm to develop an intelligent pirate agent capable of navigating a maze to find a treasure. The environment and support classes (TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py) were provided as starter code. I was responsible for completing the Q-training algorithm in the qtrain() function within the Jupyter Notebook. This included designing the agent's learning loop, implementing epsilon-greedy exploration, experience replay, and updating the neural network using feedback from game episodes. I also adjusted training parameters to achieve a 100% win rate and validated the agent’s success using the completion_check() function.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists use logical reasoning, аlgorithmic design, and computational models tо create‍ systems addressing tangible challenges. Τhis holds significance as software, automation, аnd data-c‍entric approaches underpin nearly evеry sector, spanning healthcare, finance, and еntertainment. The‍ instruments and structures dеvised by computer scientists enhance effectivеness, availability, and innovating solutions.
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I break problems down into smaller, manageable components. I define inputs and outputs, identify edge cases, and select algorithms or models that fit the structure of the problem. In this project, I approached pathfinding as a reinforcement learning problem, selecting deep Q-learning because it was well-suited for learning through trial and error in a grid-based environment.
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I have a responsibility to ensure that intelligent systems behave fairly, transparently, and safely. This includes avoiding biases in training data, protecting user privacy, and ensuring that the algorithms I implement are secure and aligned with user expectations. In organizational contexts, I must also consider how AI decisions affect people and align with the company’s values and long-term goals.
